# WhatsApp_Multiple_Sender 
Used selenium to send a message desired number of times (frequency) to contact(s) in one go over WhatsApp.

The only bottleneck is that you have to manually scan the QR code once to login to your account, rest everything is automated.

You will have to enter the contact's name (multiple if you wish), the message, and the number of times you wish to send that particular message.
