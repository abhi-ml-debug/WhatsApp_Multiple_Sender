# WhatsApp_Multiple_Sender
Send a message the desired number of times (frequency) to contact(s) in one go over WhatsApp.

The only bottleneck is that you have to manually scan QR code once to login to your account.

You will have to enter the contact's name (multiple if you wish), the message and the number of times you wish to send that particular message.
